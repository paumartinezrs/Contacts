# Contacts app

This project involves developing the backend solution for a contacts app. An API-Rest is created using Node.js and Express, following the Model-View-Controller architecture.

The project is currently under development, serving as a platform for me to explore various technologies. As of now, the data management aspect is complete, utilizing either the local file system or SQLite. Thanks to the architecture, transitioning between different models is seamless.

To run the project, simply clone the repository and execute "npm run dev". All required dependencies are listed in the package.json file.
