#Contacts app

This project consists on developing the back end solution for a contacts app. A API-Rest is created with Node.js and Express. The achitecture of the API is a Model-View-Controller architecture. 

This project is still under development and my aim to learn different techologies with it. Now, the data part is done both with local file system and with SQLite. It works fine with both and you can change within different models very easily thanks to the architecture. 

To run it and you need to do is to clone the repository and "npm run dev". The needed dependencies are shown in package.json
